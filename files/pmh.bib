abstract = {BACKGROUND: The built environment (BE) is said to influence local obesity rates. Few studies have explored causal pathways between home-neighborhood BE variables and health outcomes such as obesity. Such pathways are likely to involve both physical activity and diet. METHODS: The Seattle Obesity Study (SOS II) was a longitudinal cohort of 440 adult residents of King Co, WA. Home addresses were geocoded. Home-neighborhood BE measures were framed as counts and densities of food sources and physical activity locations. Tax parcel property values were obtained from County tax assessor. Healthy Eating Index (HEI 2010) scores were constructed using data from food frequency questionnaires. Physical activity (PA) was obtained by self-report. Weights and heights were measured at baseline and following 12Â months' exposure. Multivariable regressions examined the associations among BE measures at baseline, health behaviors (HEI-2010 and physical activity) at baseline, and health outcome both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. RESULTS: None of the conventional neighborhood BE metrics were associated either with diet quality, or with meeting PA guidelines. Only higher property values did predict better diets and more physical activity. Better diets and more physical activity were associated with lower obesity prevalence at baseline and 12 mo, but did not predict weight change. CONCLUSION: Any links between the BE and health outcomes critically depend on establishing appropriate behavioral pathways. In this study, home-centric BE measures, were not related to physical activity or to diet. Further studies will need to consider a broader range of BE attributes that may be related to diets and health.},

abstract = {This individual-level case control study analyzed the risk of occurrence of a pedestrian-motor vehicle collision at a given location on a state route in King County, Washington. With the full sample of collisions (1999-2004), binomial logit models estimated the odds of collision occurrence as related to the road and the neighborhood environments and adjusting for exposure. Separate models were run for SR-99, the principal transregional arterial with four-plus lanes (n = 826), and for all the other state routes (n = 1,602). The strongest significant correlates of the risk of collision occurrence were the presence of crosswalks with or without traffic signals, the facility's number of lanes, and the presence of nearby retail uses. Also positively significant were the number of traffic signals and the street-block size near the location and being located outside the city of Seattle. Exposure variables including road-level measures such as average daily traffic and posted speed and neighborhood-level measures such as the number of residential units and bus ridership were significant in at least one of the models. Employment density appeared to be an unreliable measure of exposure. Other pedestrian activity generators such as educational facilities were not significantly associated with the risk of collision occurrence. The strong significance of crosswalks, whether signalized or not, indicated that engineering approaches to safety should likely be complemented by education- and enforcement-based measures. Similarly, facilities in areas with concentrations of retail should become the targets of future safety programs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The health benefits of regular physical activity are well established. However, the relative contribution of heritable and environmental factors to physical activity participation remains controversial. Using a cut-point of 60 minutes of total activity per week, data from the GenomEUtwin project revealed consistent genetic influence on physical activity participation in 37,051 twin pairs from seven countries. We hypothesized that the heritability of physical activity participation would be attenuated using the CDC/ACSM recommended minimum threshold of 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity per week. METHODS: Data were obtained from 1,389 twin pairs from the community-based University of Washington Twin Registry. Twin similarity in physical activity participation using both cut-points was analyzed using tetrachoric correlations and structural equation modeling in all same-sex pairs. RESULTS: Correlations were higher in monozygotic (r(MZ) = 0.43, 95{\%} CI = 0.33-0.54) than dizygotic pairs (r(DZ) = 0.30, 95{\%} CI = 0.12-0.47) using the 60 minute cut-point. However, differences were attenuated using the 150 minute standard (r(MZ) = 0.30, 95{\%} CI = 0.20-0.40; r(DZ) = 0.25, 95{\%} CI = 0.07-0.42). Using the lower cut-point, the best fitting model of twin resemblance only included additive genetics and unique environment, with a heritability of 45{\%}. In contrast, using the higher threshold, the best fitting model included the common and unique environment, with the unique environment contributing 72{\%} of the variance. CONCLUSION: Unique environment factors provide the strongest influence on physical activity participation at levels recommended for health benefits.},

abstract = {Exposure to features of the built environment is commonly theorized to affect important health-related behaviors and conditions, such as active transportation and access to healthy foods. However, built environment has generally been measured solely within proximity of the home location. This research provides a method for measuring and summarizing environmental properties for the complete space-time realm of experience using high resolution objective data on environment and behavior. A convenience sample of fifty-one subjects was enrolled in a one week cross-sectional study, in which individual movements and activity during waking hours were tracked at a one second interval using a novel multi-sensing device that included a GPS receiver/data logger. Subjects also completed a sociodemographic survey as well as the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, a self-report based instrument for estimating physical activity levels. The characteristics of their sensed location traces were obtained using a newly developed set of analytical raster data sets known as SmartMaps, which represented spatially continuous measures of localized neighborhood values for variables within the built environment domains of neighborhood structure; utilitarian destinations; recreation; transportation and traffic; and land use composition and configuration. Three basic movement types were identified: dwells (places where no movement occurred across XY space), trips (traces that represented movement across XY space), and stops (relatively brief non-moving intervals within trips). Characteristics of different built environment variables were found to differ significantly for traces sensed at home vs. non-home locations, for trips vs. dwells, for short distance vs. long distance trips, and for fast vs. slow trips. Built environment characteristics did not differ by overall levels of self-reported physical activity. This research shows that environmental characteristics differ for home and non- home locations and for a variety of movement types. Given the amount of time that is spent away from home, estimates of the effects of environment on behavior should include not only built environment measures near home, but measures of environment for the entire realm of movement through space and time. To address this need, this research presents an operationalized method for linking objective measures of localized environment and behavior through space and time.},

abstract = {Objectives. We explored new ways to identify food deserts. Methods. We estimated physical and economic access to supermarkets for 5 low-income groups in Seattle-King County, Washington. We used geographic information system data to measure physical access: service areas around each supermarket were delineated by ability to walk, bicycle, ride transit, or drive within 10 minutes. We assessed economic access by stratifying supermarkets into low, medium, and high cost. Combining income and access criteria generated multiple ways to estimate food deserts. Results. The 5 low-income group definitions yielded total vulnerable populations ranging from 4{\%} to 33{\%} of the county's population. Almost all of the vulnerable populations lived within a 10-minute drive or bus ride of a low- or medium-cost supermarket. Yet at most 34{\%} of the vulnerable populations could walk to any supermarket, and as few as 3{\%} could walk to a low-cost supermarket. Conclusions. The criteria used to define low-income status and access to supermarkets greatly affect estimates of populations living in food deserts. Measures of access to food must include travel duration and mode and supermarket food costs. (Am J Public Health.

We address four main areas: (1) the importance of valid and comparable data concerning behaviour across geographies; (2) the ongoing need to identify and explore new environmental variables; (3) the challenge of identifying the causally relevant context; and (4) the pressing need for stronger study designs and analytical methods. Additionally, we discuss existing sources of geo-referenced health data which might be exploited by interdisciplinary research teams, personnel challenges and some aspects of funding for geospatial research by the US National Institutes of Health in the past decade, including funding for international collaboration and training opportunities.},

The present goal is to review the literature on the effects of BE on health, highlight its limitations, and explore the growing use of natural experiments in BE research, such as the advent of new supermarkets, revitalized parks, or new transportation systems. Based on recent studies on movers, a paradigm shift in built-environment health research may be imminent. Following the classic Moving to Opportunity study in the US, the present Moving to Health (M2H) strategy takes advantage of the fact that changing residential location can entail overnight changes in multiple BE variables. The necessary conditions for applying the M2H strategy to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) databases and to large longitudinal cohorts are outlined below. Also outlined are significant limitations of this approach, including the use of electronic medical records in lieu of survey data. The key research question is whether documented changes in BE exposure can be linked to changes in health outcomes in a causal manner. The use of geo-localized clinical information from regional health care systems should permit new insights into the social and environmental determinants of health.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 The Author(s). Background: Individual sociodemographic and home neighborhood built environment (BE) factors influence the probability of engaging in health-enhancing levels of walking or moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Methods are needed to parsimoniously model the associations. Methods: Participants included 2392 adults drawn from a community-based twin registry living in the Seattle region. Objective BE measures from four domains (regional context, neighborhood composition, destinations, transportation) were taken for neighborhood sizes of 833 and 1666 road network meters from home. Hosmer and Lemeshow's methods served to fit logistic regression models of walking and MVPA outcomes using sociodemographic and BE predictors. Backward elimination identified variables included in final models, and comparison of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves determined model fit improvements. Results: Built environment variables associated with physical activity were reduced from 86 to 5 or fewer. Sociodemographic and BE variables from all four BE domains were associated with activity outcomes but differed by activity type and neighborhood size. For the study population, ROC comparisons indicated that adding BE variables to a base model of sociodemographic factors did not improve the ability to predict walking or MVPA. Conclusions: Using sociodemographic and built environment factors, the proposed approach can guide the estimation of activity prediction models for different activity types, neighborhood sizes, and discrete BE characteristics. Variables associated with walking and MVPA are population and neighborhood BE-specific.},

abstract = {This study examined the correlates of injury severity using police records of pedestrian-motor-vehicle collisions on state routes and city streets in King County, Washington. Levels of influence on collision outcome considered (1) the characteristics of individual pedestrians and drivers and their actions; (2) the road environment; and (3) the neighborhood environment. Binary logistic regressions served to estimate the risk of a pedestrian being severely injured or dying versus suffering minor or no injury. Significant individual-level influences on injury severity were confirmed for both types of roads: pedestrians being older or younger; the vehicle moving straight on the roadway. New variables associated with increased risk of severe injury or death included: having more than two pedestrians involved in a collision; and on city streets, the driver being inebriated. Road intersection design was significant only in the state route models, with pedestrians crossing at intersections without signals increasing the risk of being injured or dying. Adjusting for pedestrians' and drivers' characteristics and actions, neighborhood medium home values and higher residential densities increased the risk of injury or death. No other road or neighborhood environment variable remained significant, suggesting that pedestrians were not safer in areas with high pedestrian activity.},

abstract = {Studies of social determinants of weight and health in the US have typically relied on self-reported education and incomes as the two primary measures of socioeconomic status (SES). The assessed value of one's home, an important component of wealth, may be a better measure of the underlying SES construct and a better predictor of obesity. The Seattle Obesity Study (SOS), conducted in 2008-9, was a cross-sectional random digit dial telephone survey of 2001 adults in King County, Washington State, US. Participants' addresses were geocoded and residential property values for each tax parcel were obtained from the county tax assessor's database. Prevalence ratios of obesity by property values, education, and household income were estimated separately for women and men, after adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, household size, employment status and home ownership. Among women, the inverse association between property values and obesity was very strong and independent of other SES factors. Women in the bottom quartile of property values were 3.4 times more likely to be obese than women in the top quartile. No association between property values and obesity was observed for men. The present data strengthen the evidence for a social gradient in obesity among women. Property values may represent a novel and objective measure of SES at the individual level in the US. Measures based on tax assessment data will provide a valuable resource for future health studies.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We isolated physical activity attributable to transit use to examine issues of substitution between types of physical activity and potential confounding of transit-related walking with other walking. METHODS: Physical activity and transit use data were collected in 2008 to 2009 from 693 Travel Assessment and Community study participants from King County, Washington, equipped with an accelerometer, a portable Global Positioning System, and a 7-day travel log. Physical activity was classified into transit- and non-transit-related walking and nonwalking time. Analyses compared physical activity by type between transit users and nonusers, between less and more frequent transit users, and between transit and nontransit days for transit users. RESULTS: Transit users had more daily overall physical activity and more total walking than did nontransit users but did not differ on either non-transit-related walking or nonwalking physical activity. Most frequent transit users had more walking time than least frequent transit users. Higher physical activity levels for transit users were observed only on transit days, with 14.6 minutes (12.4 minutes when adjusted for demographics) of daily physical activity directly linked with transit use. CONCLUSIONS: Because transit use was directly related to higher physical activity, future research should examine whether substantive increases in transit access and use lead to more physical activity and related health improvements.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess a county population's exposure to different types of food sources reported to affect both diet quality and obesity rates. DESIGN: Food permit records obtained from the local health department served to establish the full census of food stores and restaurants. Employing prior categorization schemes which classified the relative healthfulness of food sources based on establishment type (i.e. supermarkets v. convenience stores, or full-service v. fast-food restaurants), food establishments were assigned to the healthy, unhealthy or undetermined groups. SETTING: King County, WA, USA. SUBJECTS: Full census of food sources. RESULTS: According to all categorization schemes, most food establishments in King County fell into the unhealthy and undetermined groups. Use of the food permit data showed that large stores, which included supermarkets as healthy food establishments, contained a sizeable number of bakery/delis, fish/meat, ethnic and standard quick-service restaurants and coffee shops, all food sources that, when housed in a separate venue or owned by a different business establishment, were classified as either unhealthy or of undetermined value to health. CONCLUSIONS: To fully assess the potential health effects of exposure to the extant food environment, future research would need to establish the health value of foods in many such common establishments as individually owned grocery stores and ethnic food stores and restaurants. Within-venue exposure to foods should also be investigated.},

abstract = {Precise measurement of physical activity is important for health research, providing a better understanding of activity location, type, duration, and intensity. This article describes a novel suite of tools to measure and analyze physical activity behaviors in spatial epidemiology research. We use individual-level, high-resolution, objective data collected in a space-time framework to investigate built and social environment influences on activity. First, we collect data with accelerometers, global positioning system units, and smartphone-based digital travel and photo diaries to overcome many limitations inherent in self-reported data. Behaviors are measured continuously over the full spectrum of environmental exposures in daily life, instead of focusing exclusively on the home neighborhood. Second, data streams are integrated using common timestamps into a single data structure, the âLifeLog.â A graphic interface tool, âLifeLog View,â enables simultaneous visualization of all LifeLog data streams. Finally, we use geographic information system SmartMap rasters to measure spatially continuous environmental variables to capture exposures at the same spatial and temporal scale as in the LifeLog. These technologies enable precise measurement of behaviors in their spatial and temporal settings but also generate very large datasets; we discuss current limitations and promising methods for processing and analyzing such large datasets. Finally, we provide applications of these methods in spatially oriented research, including a natural experiment to evaluate the effects of new transportation infrastructure on activity levels, and a study of neighborhood environmental effects on activity using twins as quasi-causal controls to overcome self-selection and reverse causation problems. In summary, the integrative characteristics of large datasets contained in LifeLogs and SmartMaps hold great promise for advancing spatial epidemiologic research to promote healthy behaviors.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions. Published by BMJ. Background SafeBoda is a motorcycle taxi company that provides road safety training and helmets to its drivers in Kampala, Uganda. We sought to determine whether SafeBoda drivers are more likely to engage in safe riding behaviours than regular drivers (motorcycle taxi drivers not part of SafeBoda). Methods We measured riding behaviours in SafeBoda and regular drivers through: (1) computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI), where 400 drivers were asked about their riding behaviours (eg, helmet and mobile phone use) and (2) roadside observation, where riding behaviours were observed in 3000 boda-boda drivers and their passengers along major roads in Kampala. Results Across the two cross-sectional studies, a higher proportion of SafeBoda drivers than regular drivers engaged in safe riding behaviours. For instance, helmet use among SafeBoda compared with regular drivers was 21{\%} points higher (95{\%} CI 0.15 to 0.27; p{\textless}0.001) based on the CAPI and 45{\%} points higher (95{\%} CI 0.43 to 0.47; p{\textless}0.001) based on roadside observation. Furthermore, compared with regular drivers, SafeBoda drivers were more likely to report having a driver's license (66.3{\%} vs 33.5 {\%}; p{\textless}0.001) and a reflective jacket (99.5{\%} vs 50.5 {\%}; p{\textless}0.001) and were less likely to report driving towards oncoming traffic (4{\%} vs 45.7 {\%}; p{\textless}0.001) in the past 30 days. Conclusion The SafeBoda programme is associated with increased safe riding behaviours among motorcycle taxi drivers in Kampala. Therefore, the promotion and expansion of such programmes may lead to a reduction in morbidity and mortality due to road injuries.},

abstract = {Background: Measures of neighborhood deprivation used in health research are typically based on conventional area-based SES. Purpose: The aim of this study is to examine new data and measures of SES for use in health research. SpecifÄ±cally, assessed property values are introduced as a new individual-level metric of wealth and tested for their ability to substitute for conventional area-based SES as measures of neighborhood deprivation. Methods: The analysis was conducted in 2010 using data from 1922 participants in the 2008â2009 survey of the Seattle Obesity Study (SOS). It compared the relative strength of the association between the individual-level neighborhood wealth metric (assessed property values) and area-level SES measures (including education, income, and percentage above poverty as single variables, and as the composite Singh index) on the binary outcome fair/poor general health status. Analyses were adjusted for gender, categoric age, race, employment status, home ownership, and household income. Results: The neighborhood wealth measure was more predictive of fair/poor health status than area-level SES measures, calculated either as single variables or as indices (lower DIC measures for all models). The odds of having a fair/poor health status decreased by 0.85 (95{\%} CI0.77, 0.93) per {\$}50,000 increase in neighborhood property values after adjusting for individual-level SES measures. Conclusions: The proposed individual-level metric of neighborhood wealth, if replicated in other areas, could replace area-based SES measures, thus simplifying analyses of contextual effects on health.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Fast food restaurants reportedly target specific populations by locating in lower-income and in minority neighborhoods. Physical proximity to fast food restaurants has been associated with higher obesity rates.OBJECTIVE:To examine possible associations, at the census tract level, between area demographics, arterial road density, and fast food restaurant density in King County, WA, USA.METHODS:Data on median household incomes, property values, and race/ethnicity were obtained from King County and from US Census data. Fast food restaurant addresses were obtained from Public Health-Seattle {\&} King County and were geocoded. Fast food density was expressed per tract unit area and per capita. Arterial road density was a measure of vehicular and pedestrian access. Multivariate logistic regression models containing both socioeconomic status and road density were used in data analyses.RESULTS:Over one half (53.1{\%}) of King County census tracts had at least one fast food restaurant. Mean network distance from dwelling units to a fast food restaurant countywide was 1.40 km, and 1.07 km for census tracts containing at least one fast food restaurant. Fast food restaurant density was significantly associated in regression models with low median household income (p {\textless} 0.001) and high arterial road density (p {\textless} 0.001) but not with percent of residents who were nonwhite.CONCLUSION:No significant association was observed between census tract minority status and fast food density in King County. Although restaurant density was linked to low household incomes, that effect was attenuated by arterial road density. Fast food restaurants in King County are more likely to be located in lower income neighborhoods and higher traffic areas.},

METHODS Seven days of Global Positioning Systems (GPS) tracking data were obtained for 433 adult participants in the Seattle Obesity Study (SOS II). Heights and weights were measured. Dietary intakes from a food frequency questionnaire were used to calculate Healthy Eating Index (HEI 2010) scores. Linear regression analyses examined associations between AS measures: daily route length, convex hull, and radius of gyration, and diet quality and health outcomes, adjusting for covariates. RESULTS AS measures did not vary by age, gender, race/ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. AS measures were not associated with diet quality or with self-reported obesity or diabetes. One AS measure, route length (in miles), was associated with being employed, living in the suburbs, and with distance and time commuting to work. CONCLUSION Spatial mobility studies based on GPS tracking of environmental exposure need to demonstrate a link to relevant health outcomes.},

abstract = {This study focused on the severity of injuries and fatalities incurred by pedestrians colliding with motor vehicles. The report includes a thorough review of the literature and a description of new research carried out on correlates of injury severity and measures of their relative effects on fatal or high injury collisions. The correlates consisted of both individual-level factors and attributes of environments at or near pedestrian collision sites. The study focused on state routes in King County, Washington. Data came from police records processed by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) from 1999 to 2004. They included objective and modeled data in GIS on road characteristics, traffic conditions, and land uses at or near collision sites. The results of binary and ordinal logistic models showed that fatal and high injury collisions were strongly and significantly associated with (1) a pedestrian crossing at an unsignalized intersection (versus crossing at all other locations or walking along the roadway); (2) the vehicle moving straight ahead on the roadway (versus all other types of vehicle actions). There was a lack of association between injury severity and collision frequency, suggesting that safety programs intended to reduce the number of collisions and those intended to reduce the risk of severe injury and death should use different approaches. The latter should focus on individual factors such as driver or pedestrian actions and behaviors, as well as on road environment factors such as speed limits and intersection signalization. Finally, better reports and data on vehicular speed at the time of collision, and on the type of vehicles involved in pedestrian collisions, would help to inform effective future safety programs, policies, and standards.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 Background: Activity spaces (AS), captured using GPS tracking devices, are measures of dynamic exposure to the built environment (BE). Methods: Seven days of Global Positioning Systems (GPS) tracking data were obtained for 433 adult participants in the Seattle Obesity Study (SOS II). Heights and weights were measured. Dietary intakes from a food frequency questionnaire were used to calculate Healthy Eating Index (HEI 2010) scores. Linear regression analyses examined associations between AS measures: daily route length, convex hull, and radius of gyration, and diet quality and health outcomes, adjusting for covariates. Results: AS measures did not vary by age, gender, race/ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. AS measures were not associated with diet quality or with self-reported obesity or diabetes. One AS measure, route length (in miles), was associated with being employed, living in the suburbs, and with distance and time commuting to work. Conclusion: Spatial mobility studies based on GPS tracking of environmental exposure need to demonstrate a link to relevant health outcomes.},

abstract = {Background: In-person assessments of physical activity (PA) and body weight can be burdensome for participants and cost prohibitive for researchers. This study examined self-reported PA and weight accuracy and identified patterns of misreporting in a diverse sample. Methods: King, Pierce and Yakima county residents, aged 21â59 years (n = 728), self-reported their moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and weight, in kilograms. Self-reports were compared with minutes of bout-level MVPA, from 3 days of accelerometer data, and measured weights. Regression models examined characteristics associated with underreporting and overreporting of MVPA and weight, the potential bias introduced using each measure and the relation between perceived and measured PA and weight. Results: MVPA underreporting was higher among males and college educated participants; however, there was no differential MVPA overreporting. Weight underreporting was higher among males, those age 40â49 years and persons with obesity. Weight overreporting was higher among Hispanic participants and those reporting stress, unhappiness and fair or poor health. The estimated PAâobesity relation was similar using measured and self-reported PA but not self-reported weight. Perceived PA and weight predicted measured values. Conclusion: Self-reported PA and weight may be useful should objective measurement be infeasible; however, though population-specific adjustment for differential reporting should be considered.},

@article{Lovasi2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Environments conducive to walking may help people avoid sedentary lifestyles and associated diseases. Recent studies developed walkability models combining several built environment characteristics to optimally predict walking. Developing and testing such models with the same data could lead to overestimating one's ability to predict walking in an independent sample of the population. More accurate estimates of model fit can be obtained by splitting a single study population into training and validation sets (holdout approach) or through developing and evaluating models in different populations. We used these two approaches to test whether built environment characteristics near the home predict walking for exercise. Study participants lived in western Washington State and were adult members of a health maintenance organization. The physical activity data used in this study were collected by telephone interview and were selected for their relevance to cardiovascular disease. In order to limit confounding by prior health conditions, the sample was restricted to participants in good self-reported health and without a documented history of cardiovascular disease. RESULTS: For 1,608 participants meeting the inclusion criteria, the mean age was 64 years, 90 percent were white, 37 percent had a college degree, and 62 percent of participants reported that they walked for exercise. Single built environment characteristics, such as residential density or connectivity, did not significantly predict walking for exercise. Regression models using multiple built environment characteristics to predict walking were not successful at predicting walking for exercise in an independent population sample. In the validation set, none of the logistic models had a C-statistic confidence interval excluding the null value of 0.5, and none of the linear models explained more than one percent of the variance in time spent walking for exercise. We did not detect significant differences in walking for exercise among census areas or postal codes, which were used as proxies for neighborhoods. CONCLUSION: None of the built environment characteristics significantly predicted walking for exercise, nor did combinations of these characteristics predict walking for exercise when tested using a holdout approach. These results reflect a lack of neighborhood-level variation in walking for exercise for the population studied.},

SafeBoda is a transportation company that provides road safety training and helmets to its motorcycle taxi drivers in Kampala. We sought to determine whether risk of road traffic crash (RTC) was lower in SafeBoda compared to regular (non-SafeBoda) motorcycle taxi drivers during a 6-month follow-up period. We collected participant demographic and behavioural data at baseline using computer-assisted personal interview, and occurrence of RTC every 2Â months using text messaging and telephone interview from a cohort of 342 drivers. There were 85 crashes (31 in SafeBoda and 54 in regular drivers) during follow-up. Over the 6-month follow-up period, SafeBoda drivers were 39{\%} less likely to be involved in a RTC than regular drivers after adjusting for age, possession of a driver's license, and education (RR: 0.61, 95{\%} CI: 0.39â0.97, p =.04). These findings suggest that the SafeBoda programme results in safer driving and fewer RTCs among motorcycle taxi drivers in Kampala.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: This study developed and tested an algorithm to classify accelerometer data as walking or nonwalking using either GPS or travel diary data within a large sample of adults under free-living conditions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Participants wore an accelerometer and a GPS unit and concurrently completed a travel diary for seven consecutive days. Physical activity (PA) bouts were identified using accelerometry count sequences. PA bouts were then classified as walking or nonwalking based on a decision-tree algorithm consisting of seven classification scenarios. Algorithm reliability was examined relative to two independent analysts' classification of a 100-bout verification sample. The algorithm was then applied to the entire set of PA bouts.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The 706 participants' (mean age = 51 yr, 62{\%} female, 80{\%} non-Hispanic white, 70{\%} college graduate or higher) yielded 4702 person-days of data and had a total of 13,971 PA bouts. The algorithm showed a mean agreement of 95{\%} with the independent analysts. It classified PA into 8170 walking bouts (58.5 {\%}) and 5337 nonwalking bouts (38.2{\%}); 464 bouts (3.3{\%}) were not classified for lack of GPS and diary data. Nearly 70{\%} of the walking bouts and 68{\%} of the nonwalking bouts were classified using only the objective accelerometer and GPS data. Travel diary data helped classify 30{\%} of all bouts with no GPS data. The mean Â± SD duration of PA bouts classified as walking was 15.2 Â± 12.9 min. On average, participants had 1.7 walking bouts and 25.4 total walking minutes per day.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: GPS and travel diary information can be helpful in classifying most accelerometer-derived PA bouts into walking or nonwalking behavior.},

abstract = {Improving the built environment (BE) is viewed as one strategy to improve community diets and health. The present goal is to review the literature on the effects of BE on health, highlight its limitations, and explore the growing use of natural experiments in BE research, such as the advent of new supermarkets, revitalized parks, or new transportation systems. Based on recent studies on movers, a paradigm shift in built-environment health research may be imminent. Following the classic Moving to Opportunity study in the US, the present Moving to Health (M2H) strategy takes advantage of the fact that changing residential location can entail overnight changes in multiple BE variables. The necessary conditions for applying the M2H strategy to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) databases and to large longitudinal cohorts are outlined below. Also outlined are significant limitations of this approach, including the use of electronic medical records in lieu of survey data. The key research question is whether documented changes in BE exposure can be linked to changes in health outcomes in a causal manner. The use of geo-localized clinical information from regional health care systems should permit new insights into the social and environmental determinants of health.},
